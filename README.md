## Lets create a lotto number generator webapp

I'll help you create a lottery number generator web app using React. We'll make it generate random numbers within typical lottery ranges and make it visually appealing.

I've created a lottery number generator with the following features:

Multiple lottery types:

Powerball (5 numbers 1-69 + 1 number 1-26)
Mega Millions (5 numbers 1-70 + 1 number 1-25)
Basic Lottery (6 numbers 1-49)


Visual features:

Animated bouncing number balls
Blue balls for main numbers
Red balls for special numbers (Powerball/Mega Ball)
Clean, modern UI using shadcn/ui components


User interface:

Dropdown to select lottery type
Generate button to create new numbers
Numbers are automatically sorted for readability
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes



Would you like me to add any additional features? I could:

Add number frequency tracking
Include quick pick options
Add more lottery types
Include winning odds information
Add number history

## Can we create an artifact for this generator?

EditI'll create an HTML artifact version of the lottery number generator that can run as a standalone webpage.

Improvements over the React version:

No external dependencies required
Can be run directly in any web browser
Simpler codebase that's easier to modify



You can save this file with a .html extension and open it directly in your browser to use it. Would you like me to add any additional features or make any modifications to the design?
